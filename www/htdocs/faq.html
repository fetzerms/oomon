    <h2 class="indent" id="sec1.1">1.1 - What is OOMon?
    &nbsp;(<a href="#top">top</a>)</h2>

    <div class="section-indent">
      <p>OOMon is an Object-Oriented Monitor bot for Internet Relay
      Chat (IRC) servers. OOMon monitors various types of IRC
      activity for possible abuse. When abuse is detected, the
      OOMon may automatically remove and/or ban the abusive client
      from the server, or notify server operators for them to deal
      with the issue appropriately.</p>

      <p>The official OOMon website is <a href=
      "?p=home">http://oomon.sourceforge.net/</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="indent" id="sec1.2">1.2 - Why should I use it?
    &nbsp;(<a href="#top">top</a>)</h2>

    <div class="section-indent">
      <p>If you are an IRC server operator or administrator who
      does not want users to abuse the service you provide and/or
      support, you should run an OOMon connection monitor.</p>
    </div><!-- end div.section-indent -->

    <h2 class="indent" id="sec1.3">1.3 - What Operating Systems are
    supported? &nbsp;(<a href="#top">top</a>)</h2>

    <div class="section-indent">
      <p>Practically any Unix-like operating system should compile
      and run OOMon successfully. However, the following operating
      systems have been confirmed to run OOMon without
      problems:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>FreeBSD/OpenBSD/NetBSD</li>

        <li>Linux</li>

        <li>Solaris</li>

        <li>Cygwin (Windows)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you are running an operating system other than one
      listed above, don't despair! If you have GNU C++ and the GNU
      Standard Template Library (STL) installed, chances are OOMon
      will build successfully on your system.</p>
    </div><!-- end div.section-indent -->

    <h2 class="indent" id="sec1.4">1.4 - What IRC Servers are
    supported? &nbsp;(<a href="#top">top</a>)</h2>

    <div class="section-indent">
      <p>OOMon is known to work well with the following IRC
      Servers:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>ircd-hybrid (versions 5, 6, and 7)</li>

        <li>ircd-ratbox</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you run a different ircd version and OOMon works
      correctly on your server, please let us know by submitting a

    help? &nbsp;(<a href="#top">top</a>)</h2>

    <div class="section-indent">
      <p>There are several ways to get your questions answered. In
      the order of most likely to get answered, they are:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Check the <a href="?p=home">official OOMon web
        site</a>. In particular, read the <a href="?p=faq">FAQ</a>,
        in case your question has already been answered there.</li>

        <li>Post your question to the <a href=
        "http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/oomon-discuss">
        oomon-discuss mailing list</a>.</li>

        <li>Post your question to the <a href=
        "https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=326244">OOMon
        Help forum</a>.</li>

        <li>Join the IRC channel #OOMon on EFNet.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>When asking questions, please follow these guidelines to
      ensure prompt and accurate answers:</p>

        <p>Ask your question directly, without any unnecessary
        preamble.</p>

	    <p><b>Bad questions:</b><br />
	    Can I ask a question?<br />
	    Has anyone ever used <i>X</i>?<br />
	    Can someone help me with <i>Y</i>?<br />
	    </p>

	    <p><b>Good questions:</b><br />
	    When using <i>FOO</i>, why does <i>BAR</i> always make
	    <i>QUUX</i> disconnect?</p>

        <p>Saying "it doesn't work" is not a good problem
        description. Rather than saying, "Spambot detection doesn't
        work", say something like, "Even though I've enabled
        WATCH_SPAMBOT_NOTICES and set SPAMBOT_ACTION to KLINE, my
        OOMon never klines any spambots."</p>

        <p>Don't be annoying, obnoxious, or offensive. Please
        follow standard netiquette.</p>

        <p>Ask your question in English only. While many users
        speak other languages, asking your question in English
        ensures the greatest possible audience for your question,
        and allows others to benefit from any answers as well.</p>

        <p>On IRC, please DO NOT paste large amounts of text.
        Instead, use a "paste bin" site like <a href=
        "http://www.nomorepasting.com/">http://www.nomorepasting.com/</a>
        and paste the resulting URL to the channel.</p>

        <p>On IRC, use your space bar to separate words. Doing the
        following will likely get you removed from the channel:</p>
<pre>
&lt;n00b&gt; So
&lt;n00b&gt; I tried
&lt;n00b&gt; ".kline" and
&lt;n00b&gt; ".dline" but uhm...
&lt;n00b&gt; like...
&lt;n00b&gt; it doesn't work

    recent code? &nbsp;(<a href="#top">top</a>)</h2>

    <div class="section-indent">
      <p>Check out the instructions for <a href=

    <h2 class="indent" id="sec2.2">2.2 - Why does it take so long
    to compile OOMon? &nbsp;(<a href="#top">top</a>)</h2>

    <div class="section-indent">
      <p>A large portion of the time spent compiling OOMon is due
      to the optimizations the compiler performs. You can reduce
      the time it takes to compile OOMon by removing the
      "<code>-O</code>" flag from <code>CXXFLAGS</code> in the
      <i>makefile</i>.</p>

      <p>There is a trade-off when removing the optimize flag.
      Decreasing the compile time will probably cause OOMon to run
      slower and use memory less efficiently.</p>
    </div><!-- end div.section-indent -->

    <h2 class="indent" id="sec2.3">2.3 - Why can't I build OOMon on
    &lt;insert commercial Unix OS name&gt; &nbsp;(<a href=
    "#top">top</a>)</h2>

    <div class="section-indent">
      <p>You're probably using the broken compiler shipped with the
      OS. Please use the GNU C++ compiler to build OOMon. If you
      know you already have GNU C++ installed, enter the following
      command <em>prior</em> to running the <code>configure</code>
      script:</p>

      <p><code>CXX=g++; export CXX</code></p>

      <p>Or, if you use the <code>csh</code> or <code>tcsh</code>
      shell:</p>

    duplicate "STATS p" notices? &nbsp;(<a href=
    "#top">top</a>)</h2>

    <div class="section-indent">
      <p>Most likely you are running ircd-hybrid-7, or an ircd
      derived from it, and have the modules spy_stats_notice.so and
      spy_stats_p_notice.so both loaded. Unload one of them, and
      you'll stop seeing duplicates.</p>

    <h2 class="indent" id="sec3.2">3.2 - How do I completely
    disable Open Proxy DNSBL look-ups? &nbsp;(<a href=
    "#top">top</a>)</h2>

    <div class="section-indent">
      <p>As of OOMon-2.3, you can completely disable all DNSBL
      look-ups by setting <code>DNSBL_PROXY_ENABLE</code>:</p>

      <p><code>.set dnsbl_proxy_enable off</code></p>

      <p>Users of older version of OOMon can disable DNSBL look-ups
      by clearing the <code>DNSBL_PROXY_ZONE</code> setting:</p>

      <p><code>.set -dnsbl_proxy_zone</code></p>

    <h2 class="indent" id="sec3.3">3.3 - How do I make OOMon
    initiate a DCC request? &nbsp;(<a href="#top">top</a>)</h2>

    <div class="section-indent">
      <p>Users who IRC from behind a firewall or NAT device may
      find it useful to have the bot initiate DCC requests so that
      they do not have to open or forward TCP ports in their
      network hardware. To make OOMon initiate a DCC request, issue
      a CTCP CHAT command as follows:</p>

      <p><code>/ctcp &lt;<i>nickname</i>&gt; chat</code></p>

      <p>Note that the same rules apply in this scenario. If
      <a href=
      "help.cgi?topic=set%20oper_only_dcc">OPER_ONLY_DCC</a> is
      enabled, your userhost must match one of the masks listed an
      O: line in the config file. If no matching masks are found,
      OOMon will ignore your CTCP command.</p>

    <div class="section-indent">
      <p>Your OOMon appears to have crashed due to a bug. You can
      help me out by filling out a bug report containing the
      following information:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>The version of OOMon you were running if it was an
        official release. If it was from CVS, the date and time of
        the checkout. If it was a from a snapshot tarball, the date
        of the snapshot.</li>

        <li>A description of what you were doing when OOMon
        crashed.</li>

        <li>The last 5 to 10 lines of your <code>oomon.log</code>
        file:

        <p><code>tail -10 oomon.log</code></p>

        <li>A full backtrace of the crash using the <a href=
        "http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/gdb.html">GDB</a>
        debugger:</li>

            <p>Find the location of the resulting core file. It's
            usually called "<code>oomon.core</code>" or just
            "<code>core</code>".</p>

            <p>Change to the directory containing the source code
            to your OOMon. The version of the source code
            <em>MUST</em> match the version of the executable that
            crashed Run GDB:

            <p><code>gdb</code>&lt;<i>EXECUTABLE</i>&gt;&lt;<i>CORE</i>&gt;</p>

            <p>Make sure you replace "&lt;EXECUTABLE&gt;" with the
            OOMon executable filename that crashed and
            "&lt;CORE&gt;" with the resulting core filename. At the
            "<code>(gdb)</code>" prompt, type the following
            command:

            <p><code>bt full</code></p>

    file! Now what?</a> &nbsp;(<a href="#top">top</a>)</h2>

    <div class="section-indent">
      <p>There are several reasons for why a core file might not be
      generated:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Your OOMon was built without debug information. Rebuild
        OOMon with "<code>-g</code>" in the <code>CXXFLAGS</code>
        environment variable.</li>

        <li>Your OOMon executable was stripped. Rebuild OOMon and
        don't strip the executable this time.</li>

        <li>Your resource limits are preventing core files from
        being generated. The command to change resource limits is
        OS dependent, so check your documentation. On FreeBSD, you
        can use this command to increase the core file limit:

        <p><code>limits -c infinity</code></p>
      </ul>

      <p>If none of the above help you create core files, try
      running your OOMon from inside <a href=
      "http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/gdb.html">GDB</a>:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Start GDB (you might want to do this inside a
          <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/screen/">screen</a>
          session):

          <p><code>gdb ./oomon</code></p>

        <li>At the first "<code>(gdb)</code>" prompt, set your
        command line arguments to include the "<code>-d</code>"
        option:

          <p><code>set args -d</code></p>

        <li>Be sure to specify any other command line arguments you
        would normally use. At the next "<code>(gdb)</code>"
        prompt, run your OOMon:

          <p><code>run</code></p>

        <li>Now let your OOMon run until it crashes. When that
        happens, enter the following command at the
        "<code>(gdb)</code>" prompt:

          <p><code>bt full</code></p>

        <li>Copy the entire output of this command to your bug
        report.</li>

    Why C++?</a> &nbsp;(<a href="#top">top</a>)</h2>

    <div class="section-indent">
      <p>I started writing OOMon while I was taking a C++ course at
      the <a href="http://www.arizona.edu">University of
      Arizona</a>. At the time, I had made some minor modifications
      to the TCM (Texas.NET Connection Monitor) bot source code,
      and I realized how much more pleasant it would have been to
      work on TCM had it been written using object orientation.</p>

      <p>Don't get me wrong--TCM was an amazing piece of work at
      the time. In fact, much of OOMon's code is based on TCM, so
      it deserves much credit. However, I wanted to apply what I
      learned in my C++ course to make a better connection monitor
      bot.</p>

    <div class="section-indent">
      <p>First, don't use my OOMon code as a model for good C++
      programming. At heart, I'm really an x86 assembly and C
      programmer. I learned C++ later on and that fact probably
      shows well in my code. I'm still learning, however, so I'm
      gradually rewriting various pieces of OOMon to make it better
      and better.</p>
