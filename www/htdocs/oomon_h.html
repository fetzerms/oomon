<B>NOTE</B>: As of OOMon v2.0, this document is no longer accurate.  Please
refer to the <A HREF="help.cgi?topic=set">.set</A> command for information
on how to configure your OOMon.  The following is included for historical
purposes and to provide assistance to anyone who is still running an old
version of OOMon.

 Unless you plan on doing any debugging, you should leave these defines as
 they are.  Turning debug on can produce large amounts of output.

 Again, these options are probably going to be just fine in their default
 state.

 <UL><PRE>
#define USE_CRYPT
 </PRE></UL>
 If you want to use plaintext password fields or if your operating system
 does not have a crypt(3) function, undefine USE_CRYPT.  If USE_CRYPT is
 defined but configure was unable to find a crypt(3) function, a warning
 message will be displayed during a make, indicating that plaintext
 passwords are being used.  Note that encrypted passwords only apply to
 <A HREF="oomon_cf.html#o_lines">O: lines</A> in the config files.
</LI><P>
<B><LI>Ircd flags</B>
 <UL><PRE>
#undef USE_FLAGS
 </PRE></UL>
 If you are using OOMon on a server running ircd-comstud, you should
 define USE_FLAGS.  Comstud's ircd uses the FLAGS command to turn on
 the passing of various server notices which OOMon depends upon.  Using
 this option with other versions of ircd may produce unpredictable
 results.
</LI><P>
<B><LI>Automatic k-lines</B>
 <UL><PRE>
#undef AUTO_KLINE_HOST

#define AUTO_KLINE_NOIDENT

#define AUTO_KLINE_USERHOST
 </PRE></UL>
 These three defines tell OOMon if and when it should automatically
 k-line clones, flooders, etc.  AUTO_KLINE_HOST controls whether OOMon
 will automatically k-line masks in the format *@hostname.domain.com.
 AUTO_KLINE_NOIDENT controls k-line masks in the format ~*@*.domain.com.
 AUTO_KLINE_USERHOST controls k-line masks in the format
 *user@*.domain.com.  The defaults shown above should suit your needs.
</LI><P>
<B><LI>AutoPilot default setting</B>
 <UL><PRE>
#define AUTOPILOT_DEFAULT       true
 </PRE></UL>
 This define sets the value of AutoPilot when OOMon is started.
 Acceptable values are true and false.
</LI><P>
<B><LI>The .multi command</B>
 <UL><PRE>
#define MULTI_MINIMUM           3

#define NO_OPERS_IN_MULTI
 </PRE></UL>
 The MULTI_MINIMUM define sets the default minimum number of connections
 to report when using the .multi, .umulti, and .hmulti commands.  If
 NO_OPERS_IN_MULTI is defined, OOMon will not count opers when detecting
 multiple connections.
</LI><P>
<B><LI>Watching TRACE requests</B>
 <UL><PRE>
#undef TRACE_BASTARD
 </PRE></UL>
 Eggdrops, when their desired nicknames are in use by another user, will
 continuously send TRACE requests to the server in order to detect when
 the user signs off IRC.  If you consider this behaviour unacceptable,
 define TRACE_BASTARD.
</LI><P>
<B><LI>Detecting virtual host clones</B>
 <UL><PRE>
#define DETECT_VHOST_CLONES

#define VHOST_NETMASK "255.255.255.0"

#define MAX_IP_CONNECTS 5
#define MAX_IP_TIME 10
 </PRE></UL>
 Most modern version of ircd, including hybrid and comstud, report a
 client's IP in his connect server notice.  OOMon can take advantage of
 this feature to detect when a large number of clones connect from
 the same IP subnet.
 <P>
 To turn off this detection, undefine DETECT_VHOST_CLONES.
 <P>
 To change the size of the subnet mask used for detecting virtual host
 clones, modify VHOST_NETMASK.  The default value will detect /24
 (also known as class C) or smaller subnet clones.
 <P>
 MAX_IP_CONNECTS and MAX_IP_TIME control how strict OOMon should be
 when detecting virtual host clones.  The default values show above
 imply OOMon should notify connected opers when 5 or more clients from
 the same subnet connect in 10 seconds or less.
</LI><P>
<B><LI>Detecting open-access WinGates</B>
 <UL><PRE>
#define DETECT_WINGATES

#undef AUTO_DLINE_WINGATES
#define AUTO_KLINE_WINGATES

#define WINGATE_KLINE_TIME      0
 </PRE></UL>
 If you want to allow clients to connect through open-access WinGates
 and wreak havoc over your IRC network, undefine DETECT_WINGATES.  The
 WinGate detector will attempt a connection to the telnet (23) port
 of all connecting clients' IP addresses.  If you or your Internet
 Service Provider find this unacceptable, you may want to turn off the
 detector.
 <P>
 When OOMon detects an open-access WinGate, it has three options:  It
 can d-line it, k-line it, or simply report it.  If your ircd does not
 support the DLINE command, or if you prefer a k-line, leave
 AUTO_DLINE_WINGATES undefined and AUTO_KLINE_WINGATES defined.  If
 both options are defined, the client's IP address will be d-lined, as
 AUTO_DLINE_WINGATES has higher precedence.
 <P>
 If you choose to k-line open-access WinGates and you would prefer that
 the k-line be lifted some time later, define WINGATE_KLINE_TIME to be
 the number of minutes the k-line should stay in effect.  Note that in
 order for this to work, your ircd MUST support temporary k-lines.
</LI><P>
<B><LI>Detecting open-access SOCKS proxies</B>
 <UL><PRE>
#define DETECT_PROXIES

#undef AUTO_DLINE_PROXIES
#define AUTO_KLINE_PROXIES

#define PROXY_KLINE_TIME        0
 </PRE></UL>
 Like the open-access WinGate detector, OOMon's open-access SOCKS proxy
 detector will attempt to make a connection to port 1080 on each clients'
 IP address.  See the WinGate detector section for details.
</LI><P>
<B><LI>K-lines an E: lines</B>
 <UL><PRE>
#define DONT_KLINE_OUR_E
 </PRE></UL>
 If you don't want OOMon k-lining or suggesting k-lines on clients
 matching <A HREF="oomon_cf.html#e_lines">E: lines</A> in the config
 files, define this option.
</LI><P>
<B><LI>Illegal top-level domain spoofers</B>
 <UL><PRE>
 #define KILL_ILLEGAL_TLD_DNS_SPOOFERS
 </PRE></UL>
 If a client connects and its hostname does not end in "net", "com", "org",
 "gov", "edu", "mil", "int", or any two-letter country abbreviation, when
 this option is defined, OOMon will automatically kill the client's
 connection.  This does NOT affect clients with non-resolving IP addresses.
</LI><P>
<B><LI>Automatic kills</B>
 <UL><PRE>
#define AUTO_KILL_NICK_FLOODING

#define AUTO_KILL_INFO_LOOKERS

#define MAX_MOTD_LOOKS 2
#define MAX_MOTD_TIME 600

#define MAX_INFO_LOOKS 2
#define MAX_INFO_TIME 600
 </PRE></UL>
 These defines control if and when OOMon should automatically kill nick
 flooders, link lookers, trace lookers, motd lookers, and info lookers.
</LI><P>
<B><LI>IRC Services</B>
 <UL><PRE>
#define SERVICES
#define AUTOKSERVICES
#define AUTO_KLINE_SERVICES

#define SERVICES_NICK           "x@services.us"
#define SERVICES_NAME           "services.us"
#define CA_SERVICES_NAME        "services.ca"
 </PRE></UL>
 OOMon has the ability to query IRC services for a list of clients with
 multiple connections on multiple IRC servers.  If your IRC network
 does not have services which can provide this information, or if you
 would prefer not to use it, undefine SERVICES.
 <P>
 If you want OOMon to kill or k-line clones reported by services, be
 sure to leave AUTOKSERVICES defined.  If you want OOMon to k-line
 clones detected by services, leave AUTO_KLINE_SERVICES defined.
 <P>
 SERVICES_NICK should be set to the nick OOMon should query for clones.
 SERVICES_NAME is the address OOMon should expect replies from.
 <P>
 OOMon also supports an alternative version of services, used on EFnet
 for a short while.  CA_SERVICES_NAME is the address OOMon expects to
 receive replies from.
