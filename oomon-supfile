# Thanks for using OOMon, the object-oriented monitor bot
# by Timothy "Toast" Jensen
#
# Unfortunately, because I am constantly making changes to OOMon, I
# can't make any guarantees about the stability of the source code
# you download using CVSup.  ALWAYS keep a backup of your executable
# before updating and rebuilding, so that you can quickly downgrade
# to a more stable version should a serious bug be introduced.
#
# The code SHOULD always be able to compile, as I do actually perform
# a little testing of my own before committing my changes to the
# repository.  Otherwise, you're on your own! :)
#
# Don't have CVSup?  You can get it from:
#       http://www.polstra.com/projects/freeware/CVSup/
# I recommend you download a precompiled binary (if one is available
# for your platform), as trying to compile it on your own may prove
# difficult, for various reasons.
#
# To download the latest source tree using the X interface, run cvsup
# as follows:
#
#      cvsup oomon-supfile
#
# If you are not running X or you simply don't want to use the cvsup
# X interface, run it as follows:
#
#      cvsup -g -L 2 oomon-supfile
#

# This is the primary site (thanks LarZ!)
*default host=cvsup.blackened.com

# Change this if you want to put the source tree in a particular
# directory.  Otherwise, CVSup just plops it into your current
# working directory.

# The rest you probably don't want to change.

# 2.x branch, it should be "."
