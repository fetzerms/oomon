OOMon-2.0                                                (31 May 2003)
---------
	* added ".set" command!  OOMon is almost entirely configurable
	  at run-time now.  You no longer need to recompile whenever
	  you need to change a setting.

	* added interface to SpamTrap.

	* added HTTP proxy detector (scans ports 80, 1080, 3128, and
	  8080).

	* added ".watch" command for enabling/disabling various types
	  of messages OOMon sends.  Each user can configure his own
	  watch list to his liking.

	* added the ability for connected opers to see client connects,
	  disconnects, and nick changes through the use of the .watch
	  command.

	* added the ability for connected opers to see private messages
	  send to the OOMon via IRC.  This is also configurable using
	  the .watch command.

	* added new wildcard characters for nickname matching:
	    #  matches 1 numeric character
	    &  matches 1 alphabetical character
	    %  matches 1 numeric or alphabetical character
	  Example:
	    .nfind &&&-###

	* rewrote large portions of the clone and flood detection
	  routines.

	* added "-count" and "-remove" parameters to the .findk and
	  .findd commands.

	* the ".iplist" command is now an alias to the ".list"
	  command.  ".list" is now able to search clients by IP or
	  hostname.

	* added "-class <class>" argument to ".list" and ".killlist"
	  commands.  Examples:
	    .list -class opers *@*.net
	    .killlist -class 7 *ivan@*.ru clones

	* added ".seedrand" command and automatic random-nick drone
	  detection.

	* wingate detector now catches proxies that send a
	  "Enter : <host> [port] :" prompt.

	* added ".status" command for viewing various OOMon internals

	* settings (see ".set" command) and traps (see ".trap" command)
	  are now saved to a file

	* added detection for juped channel joiners

	* added ability to trap clients by IP address

	* OOMon will now detect when users /oper up

	* added ability to track temporary k-lines.  Please note that
	  this should not be enabled unless your ircd is configured
	  to send server notices when temporary k-lines expire!

	* IRC notices and messages are now logged

	* traps (see ".trap" command) can now trap nick changes as
	  well as connects

	* added ability to automatically k-line users who trigger
	  "Invalid username" server notices.

	* added ability to store k-line (temporary and permanent)
	  reasons internally in a format that is similar to hybrid.
	  When enabled, a date/time stamp is appeneded to k-line
	  reasons in the internal database.

	* updated help for various commands

	* config file and PID file filenames can now be specified
	  at the command line.  All other filenames can be changed
	  in the config file.

	* fixed broken CTCP CHAT handler.

	* stdout/stderr are now redirected to /dev/null when forking
	  OOMon into the background.

	* improved the logic that detects unresolved IP addresses.

	* "cluster" routine is now smarter regarding two-letter TLDs.

	* unauthed connects are now unable to chat or see chatter from
	  other OOMon users when UNAUTHED_MAY_CHAT is OFF.

	* remote links/trace/stats/etc. flooding no longer causes the
	  OOMon to try to kill or kline the client.  Instead, OOMon
	  will simply report the abuse.  Only local clients may be
	  killed or klined for flooding.

	* fixed problem when OOMon's desired nickname is already in
	  use.
