	  command for more information.

	  disconnected from the server.

	* Code now compiles successfully with GNU C++ 3.2.

	* "^Bnickname^B is still being processed." notices from
	  SpamTrap are now ignored.

	* Changed /stats p reply to leave out the bot's nick.

	* Fixed the clone detection and k-lining routines.

	* Fixed the SOCKS4 open proxy detector.

	* Added a SOCKS5 open proxy detector.

	* Fixed how the configuration file parser handles filenames.
	  A filename with a leading '/' character is parsed as an absolute
	  pathname, while a filename without the leading '/' is parsed
	  as a relative pathname.

	* E: lines in configuration file are now matched against
	  client IP addresses (when available) as well as hostnames.

	* Fixed .clones command's output.

	* Bot should no longer kill opers for links looking, etc.

	* Added UMODE setting.

	* The .status command's output now combines the user counts
	  into one line.

	* Added STATSP_MESSAGE setting for sending a custom message
	  to clients who issue "/stats p".

	* Added up-time and connect-time values to .status output.

	* Added support for temporary d-lines.

	* Added ability to search only temporary or permanent k-lines
	  and d-lines.  Use ".help findk" and ".help findd" for more
	  information.

	* Added a .glist command for searching clients by their GECOS
	  field.

	* Added support for "-count" parameter to .list, .nfind,
	  .seedrand, and .glist commands.

	* The .status command's output now displays the number of
	  permanent k-lines and d-lines, in addition to the total
	  number of k-lines and d-lines.

	* Added the ability to search k-lines and d-lines by their
	  reason fields.  Example: .findk -reason /WAS+UP/

	* The bot now relays "KLINE over-ruled for ..." and "DLINE
	  over-ruled for ..." server notices.

	* Added a signoff message parameter to the .die command.

	* Added RELAY_MSGS_TO_LOCOPS setting so that messages to the
	  bot are relayed to all local opers via the LOCOPS command.

	* The bot will now automatically reload its k-line list when
	  it sees a "<oper> is clearing temp klines" server notice.
	  Same for the d-line list.

	* Added SMART_KLINE and SMART_KLINE_IP action types.  Use the
	  ".info actions" command for more information.

	* The .list, .nfind, .seedrand, and .glist commands now have
	  configurable output formats.  See the LIST_FORMAT,
	  NFIND_FORMAT, SEEDRAND_FORMAT, and GLIST_FORMAT settings.

	* The bot can now relay g-line requests, triggers, and
	  activates.  See the .watch command for more information.

	  See ".help info" or just ".info" for more information.

	* Added DEFAULT_KLINE_TIMEOUT and DEFAULT_DLINE_TIMEOUT
	  settings.

	* The bot will now keep track of the number of client connects
	  that occur in 10 seconds and report when it exceeds a
	  configurable threshhold.  See the USER_COUNT_DELTA_MAX
	  setting.

	* The bot now caches proxy scanner results so that clean hosts
	  aren't scanned excessively.

	* Added more .watch types: STATS, JUPES, LINKS, MOTDS, INFOS,
	  TRACES, etc.

	* Rewrote much of the .trap command.  The command syntax has changed
	  but it is also much more flexible now.

	* The bot will now read the PID file when it starts and exit
	  if an instance of OOMon is already running.  This should
	  make it much easier to run OOMon from a crontab.

	* Added a .killnfind command that works much like the
	  .killlist command but by nick instead of user@host.

	* Added support for "Possible Flooder ..." server notices.

	* Added support for "... is a possible spambot" server
	  notices.

	* Added support for "Too many local connections for ..."
	  server notices.

	* OOMon users with "O" flags are now able to view settings and
	  traps.  Modifying settings and traps is still limited to
	  users with "M" flags.

---------
	* added ".set" command!  OOMon is almost entirely configurable
	  at run-time now.  You no longer need to recompile whenever
	  you need to change a setting.

	* added interface to SpamTrap.

	* added HTTP proxy detector (scans ports 80, 1080, 3128, and
	  8080).

	* added ".watch" command for enabling/disabling various types
	  of messages OOMon sends.  Each user can configure his own
	  watch list to his liking.

	* added the ability for connected opers to see client connects,
	  disconnects, and nick changes through the use of the .watch
	  command.

	* added the ability for connected opers to see private messages
	  send to the OOMon via IRC.  This is also configurable using
	  the .watch command.

	* added new wildcard characters for nickname matching:
	    #  matches 1 numeric character
	    &  matches 1 alphabetical character
	    %  matches 1 numeric or alphabetical character
	  Example:
	    .nfind &&&-###

	* rewrote large portions of the clone and flood detection
	  routines.

	* added "-count" and "-remove" parameters to the .findk and
	  .findd commands.

	* the ".iplist" command is now an alias to the ".list"
	  command.  ".list" is now able to search clients by IP or
	  hostname.

	* added "-class <class>" argument to ".list" and ".killlist"
	  commands.  Examples:
	    .list -class opers *@*.net
	    .killlist -class 7 *ivan@*.ru clones

	* added ".seedrand" command and automatic random-nick drone
	  detection.

	* wingate detector now catches proxies that send a
	  "Enter : <host> [port] :" prompt.

	* added ".status" command for viewing various OOMon internals

	* settings (see ".set" command) and traps (see ".trap" command)
	  are now saved to a file

	* OOMon will now detect when users /oper up

	* added ability to track temporary k-lines.  Please note that
	  this should not be enabled unless your ircd is configured
	  to send server notices when temporary k-lines expire!

	* IRC notices and messages are now logged

	* traps (see ".trap" command) can now trap nick changes as
	  well as connects

	* added ability to automatically k-line users who trigger
	  "Invalid username" server notices.

	* added ability to store k-line (temporary and permanent)
	  reasons internally in a format that is similar to hybrid.
	  When enabled, a date/time stamp is appeneded to k-line
	  reasons in the internal database.

	* updated help for various commands

	* config file and PID file filenames can now be specified
	  at the command line.  All other filenames can be changed
	  in the config file.

	* fixed broken CTCP CHAT handler.

	* stdout/stderr are now redirected to /dev/null when forking
	  OOMon into the background.

	* improved the logic that detects unresolved IP addresses.

	* "cluster" routine is now smarter regarding two-letter TLDs.

	* unauthed connects are now unable to chat or see chatter from
	  other OOMon users when UNAUTHED_MAY_CHAT is OFF.

	* remote links/trace/stats/etc. flooding no longer causes the
	  OOMon to try to kill or kline the client.  Instead, OOMon
	  will simply report the abuse.  Only local clients may be
	  killed or klined for flooding.

	* fixed problem when OOMon's desired nickname is already in
	  use.
