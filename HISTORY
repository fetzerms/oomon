OOMon-2.3                                                (?? Oct 2004)
---------
        * Added an open HTTP POST proxy scanner.

        * Added config file "proxy-send:" and "proxy-match:" lines to
          support the new HTTP POST proxy scanner.

        * Added support for a config file "proxy-target:" line to
          direct the IP and port number to try to connect to when
          scanning for open proxies.

        * Renamed the "W:" line to "proxy-vhost:" and moved the
          sample line to a new sample scanners.cf file.

        * Added the "SCAN_MAX_COUNT" setting to limit the number of
          simultaneous open proxy scans to help prevent resource
          starvation.

        * Added the "SCAN_TIMEOUT" setting to limit the number of
          seconds OOMon will remain connected while scanning for
          open proxies.

        * Log all DCC CHAT and CTCP CHAT failures.

        * Deprecated "O:" lines with empty handle fields.

        * Added support for "EC:" lines for exluding entire user
          classes.

        * Added an optional field to "E:" and "EC:" lines for
          specifying what types of abuse to exempt.

        * Log when reloading the config.

        * After authenticating, notify bot masters if the OOMon is
          not opered up.

        * Refactored the config file reading code.

        * Added a PING/PONG protocol to OOMon linking code to help
          detect links that stop functioning.

        * Added DNSBL and PROXYSCANS watch types.

        * Added ".hlist", ".iplist", and ".ulist" commands.

        * Added a ".vclones" command.

        * Improved the performance of reading the server's K-line
          and D-line lists.  On servers with very large numbers of
          K-lines and D-lines, this should substantially decrease
          the amount of time it takes for OOMon to sync up.

        * Log when sending a KNOCK to a channel.

        * Improved the performance of the ".domains" and ".nets"
          commands.

        * Added a ".findu" command for elaborate user searching.

        * Refactored much of the trap code, allowing for more robust
          filters.

        * Added trap indexes for easier trap ordering and removal.

        * Added a NOTICES .watch type to allow users to monitor
          NOTICEs sent to the bot.

        * Added TRAP_CTCP_VERSIONS, TRAP_NOTICES, and TRAP_PRIVMSGS
          settings for the enabling/disabling of traps matching CTCP
          VERSION replies, NOTICEs, and PRIVMSGs directed at the bot.

        * Added SCAN_HTTP_CONNECT_PORTS, SCAN_HTTP_POST_PORTS,
          SCAN_SOCKS4_PORTS, SCAN_SOCKS5_PORTS, and SCAN_WINGATE_PORTS
          settings for configuring what port numbers to scan for open
          proxies.

        * Added the ability to monitor CTCP VERSION replies using the
          .watch command.

        * Added support for broadcasting commands to all linked
          OOMons:
             .kline@* 60 foo@bar mass temp kline reason

        * Don't kline users for services-detected clones if they are
          "E:" lined in the OOMon config.

        * Added support for a "D:" line in the config file to define
          a fixed TCP port number to listen to when initiating a DCC
          CHAT session.

        * Moved autoconf-related files to autoconf/ subdirectory.

        * Added DNSBL_PROXY_ENABLE setting for enabling/disabling
          DNSBL lookups.

        * Log the bot's quit reason to help diagnose problems.

        * Added support for special formatting tokens in kill/kline/dline
          reasons for clones, flooding, etc.  For example, to show the
          flood rate in the nick flood kill/kline/dline reason:
            .set nick_flood_reason nick flooding (%r)

        * Fixed help for "set watch_jupe_notices".

        * Moved sample "P:", "C:", and "L:" lines to sample remotes.cf
          config file.

        * Enhanced proxy cache hit code.

        * Standardized on O_NONBLOCK method for using non-blocking
          socket code.


OOMon-2.2                                                (01 Apr 2004)
---------
	* Fixed the remote bot linking code.  Bot linking now works!!!
	  See the "remotes.cf" file for examples of how to set up 'R'
	  lines to give remote users access.

	* Added the ability to send CTCP VERSION requests to all
	  connecting users and to .trap on CTCP VERSION replies.  Also
	  added the ability to perform an action when the OOMon does
	  not receive a CTCP VERSION reply within a configurable
	  timeout.  See the ".set CTCPVERSION_ENABLE" help for details.

	* Added ability to restore default watches using the ".watch
	  defaults" command.

	* Added connect flood detection.

	* Greatly improved the virtual host clone detection.  It now
	  detects vhosted clones instead of connect floods! :-)

	* On servers supporting it, send KNOCKs to +i channels when
	  unable to join them.  Also, automatically join when invited
	  to those channels.

	* Added watch type, "JUPES", for watching notices indicating
	  a user attempted to join a juped channel.

	* Added support for ircd CASEMAPPING types: ascii, rfc1459, and
	  strict-rfc1459.  The default is assumed to be rfc1459.

	* Added "-a" and "-t" arguments to the ".trap list" command to
	  allow users to display the number of matches and the timestamp
	  of the last match.

	* Added the ability to query multiple Open Proxy DNSBL zones.
	  See the ".set DNSBL_PROXY_ZONE" help for details.
	  Note:  Make sure you have ADNS installed before you set up
	         your OOMon to query multiple zones.

	* Client usernames and hostnames are now stored internally
	  in their original upper- and lowercase formatting.

	* Fixed bug #857688 - User watches don't get loaded from the
	  db file.

	* When responding to "/stats p" requests, don't use the plural
	  form of "oper" if there is only 1 OOMon oper connected.

	* Added a ".locops" command.

	* Added ".drones" to be a synonym for ".seedrand".

	* Renamed the SMART_KLINE action type to SMART_KLINE_HOST and
	  added a new SMART_KLINE that klines *@hostname if the hostname
	  appears dynamic or klines *user@net.* (or *user@*.domain if
	  no IP address is available) if the hostname does not appear
	  dynamic.

	* Added the ability to monitor failed /oper attempts.  See
	  ".watch OPERFAILS".

	* Added a very simple "mkpasswd" utility to generating
	  passwords suitable for .cf files.

	* Added support for the GNU ADNS library.  This should help
	  keep OOMon responsive even when it is doing lots of DNSBL
	  queries.

	* Show the number of proxy cache hits and misses in .status
	  command output.

	* Added settings: CLONE_MAX_TIME, CLONE_MIN_COUNT,
	  CLONE_REPORT_FORMAT, CLONE_REPORT_INTERVAL, CTCPVERSION_ENABLE,
	  CTCPVERSION_TIMEOUT, CTCPVERSION_TIMEOUT_ACTION,
	  CTCPVERSION_TIMEOUT_REASON, CONNECT_FLOOD_ACTION,
	  CONNECT_FLOOD_MAX_COUNT, CONNECT_FLOOD_MAX_TIME,
	  CONNECT_FLOOD_REASON, OPERFAIL_ACTION, OPERFAIL_MAX_COUNT,
	  OPERFAIL_MAX_TIME, OPERFAIL_REASON, SERVER_TIMEOUT,
	  TRACK_PERM_DLINES, TRACK_PERM_KLINES, WATCH_OPERFAIL_NOTICES,
	  XO_SERVICES_CLONE_ACTION, XO_SERVICES_CLONE_REASON

	* Internal change: Added support for Boost libraries.  This has
	  grown the source tarball quite a bit.

	* Internal change: Lots of optimizations and clean-ups.

	* Internal change: Rewrote the XO-style services handler code.


OOMon-2.1                                                (20 Nov 2003)
---------

	  clients by IP instead of hostname.


	* Fixed broken virtual host support.

	* Fixed the clone detection and k-lining routines.

	* Fixed the SOCKS4 open proxy detector.

	* Added a SOCKS5 open proxy detector.

	* Fixed how the configuration file parser handles filenames.
	  A filename with a leading '/' character is parsed as an absolute
	  pathname, while a filename without the leading '/' is parsed
	  as a relative pathname.

	* E: lines in configuration file are now matched against
	  client IP addresses (when available) as well as hostnames.

	* Fixed .clones command's output.

	* Bot should no longer kill opers for links looking, etc.

	* Added UMODE setting.

	* The .status command's output now combines the user counts
	  into one line.

	* Added STATSP_MESSAGE setting for sending a custom message
	  to clients who issue "/stats p".

	* Added up-time and connect-time values to .status output.

	* Added support for temporary d-lines.

	* Added ability to search only temporary or permanent k-lines
	  and d-lines.  Use ".help findk" and ".help findd" for more
	  information.

	  field.

	* Added support for "-count" parameter to .list, .nfind,
	  .seedrand, and .glist commands.

	* The .status command's output now displays the number of
	  permanent k-lines and d-lines, in addition to the total
	  number of k-lines and d-lines.

	* Added the ability to search k-lines and d-lines by their
	  reason fields.  Example: .findk -reason /WAS+UP/

	* The bot now relays "KLINE over-ruled for ..." and "DLINE
	  over-ruled for ..." server notices.

	* Added a signoff message parameter to the .die command.

	* Added RELAY_MSGS_TO_LOCOPS setting so that messages to the
	  bot are relayed to all local opers via the LOCOPS command.

	* The bot will now automatically reload its k-line list when
	  it sees a "<oper> is clearing temp klines" server notice.
	  Same for the d-line list.

	* Added SMART_KLINE and SMART_KLINE_IP action types.  Use the
	  ".info actions" command for more information.

	* The .list, .nfind, .seedrand, and .glist commands now have
	  configurable output formats.  See the LIST_FORMAT,
	  NFIND_FORMAT, SEEDRAND_FORMAT, and GLIST_FORMAT settings.

	  See ".help info" or just ".info" for more information.

	* Added DEFAULT_KLINE_TIMEOUT and DEFAULT_DLINE_TIMEOUT
	  settings.

	* The bot will now keep track of the number of client connects
	  that occur in 10 seconds and report when it exceeds a
	  configurable threshhold.  See the USER_COUNT_DELTA_MAX
	  setting.

	* The bot now caches proxy scanner results so that clean hosts
	  aren't scanned excessively.

	* Added more .watch types: STATS, JUPES, LINKS, MOTDS, INFOS,
	  TRACES, etc.

	* Rewrote much of the .trap command.  The command syntax has changed
	  but it is also much more flexible now.

	* The bot will now read the PID file when it starts and exit
	  if an instance of OOMon is already running.  This should
	  make it much easier to run OOMon from a crontab.

	* Added a .killnfind command that works much like the
	  .killlist command but by nick instead of user@host.

	* Added support for "Possible Flooder ..." server notices.

	* Added support for "... is a possible spambot" server
	  notices.

	* Added support for "Too many local connections for ..."
	  server notices.

	* OOMon users with "O" flags are now able to view settings and
	  traps.  Modifying settings and traps is still limited to
	  users with "M" flags.

---------
	* added ".set" command!  OOMon is almost entirely configurable
	  at run-time now.  You no longer need to recompile whenever
	  you need to change a setting.

	* added interface to SpamTrap.

	* added HTTP proxy detector (scans ports 80, 1080, 3128, and
	  8080).

	* added ".watch" command for enabling/disabling various types
	  of messages OOMon sends.  Each user can configure his own
	  watch list to his liking.

	* added the ability for connected opers to see client connects,
	  disconnects, and nick changes through the use of the .watch
	  command.

	* added the ability for connected opers to see private messages
	  send to the OOMon via IRC.  This is also configurable using
	  the .watch command.

	* added new wildcard characters for nickname matching:
	    #  matches 1 numeric character
	    &  matches 1 alphabetical character
	    %  matches 1 numeric or alphabetical character
	  Example:
	    .nfind &&&-###

	* rewrote large portions of the clone and flood detection
	  routines.

	* added "-count" and "-remove" parameters to the .findk and
	  .findd commands.

	* the ".iplist" command is now an alias to the ".list"
	  command.  ".list" is now able to search clients by IP or
	  hostname.

	* added "-class <class>" argument to ".list" and ".killlist"
	  commands.  Examples:
	    .list -class opers *@*.net
	    .killlist -class 7 *ivan@*.ru clones

	* added ".seedrand" command and automatic random-nick drone
	  detection.

	* wingate detector now catches proxies that send a
	  "Enter : <host> [port] :" prompt.

	* added ".status" command for viewing various OOMon internals

	* settings (see ".set" command) and traps (see ".trap" command)
	  are now saved to a file

	* added detection for juped channel joiners

	* added ability to trap clients by IP address

	* OOMon will now detect when users /oper up

	* added ability to track temporary k-lines.  Please note that
	  this should not be enabled unless your ircd is configured
	  to send server notices when temporary k-lines expire!

	* IRC notices and messages are now logged

	* traps (see ".trap" command) can now trap nick changes as
	  well as connects

	* added ability to automatically k-line users who trigger
	  "Invalid username" server notices.

	* added ability to store k-line (temporary and permanent)
	  reasons internally in a format that is similar to hybrid.
	  When enabled, a date/time stamp is appeneded to k-line
	  reasons in the internal database.

	* updated help for various commands

	* config file and PID file filenames can now be specified
	  at the command line.  All other filenames can be changed
	  in the config file.

	* fixed broken CTCP CHAT handler.

	* stdout/stderr are now redirected to /dev/null when forking
	  OOMon into the background.

	* improved the logic that detects unresolved IP addresses.

	* "cluster" routine is now smarter regarding two-letter TLDs.

	* unauthed connects are now unable to chat or see chatter from
	  other OOMon users when UNAUTHED_MAY_CHAT is OFF.

	* remote links/trace/stats/etc. flooding no longer causes the
	  OOMon to try to kill or kline the client.  Instead, OOMon
	  will simply report the abuse.  Only local clients may be
	  killed or klined for flooding.

	* fixed problem when OOMon's desired nickname is already in
	  use.
