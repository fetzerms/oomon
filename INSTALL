*** HOW TO COMPILE OOMON:

First, run the configure script as follows:

	./configure [options]

Type "./configure --help" to get a list of options you may use.  The
following options are specific to OOMon:

  --enable-pcre[=DIR]
    By default, the configure script will attempt to automatically
    determine if the Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions library is
    available on your system.  Use this option to tell configure
    where the PCRE files are located if it is unable to locate them
    on its own.
    
  --enable-adns[=DIR]
    By default, the configure script will attempt to automatically
    determine if the ADNS Alternative DNS resolver library is
    available on your system.  Use this option to tell configure
    where the ADNS files are located if it is unable to locate them
    on its own.
    
  --enable-gdbm[=DIR]
    By default, the configure script will attempt to automatically
    determine if GDBM database routines are available on your system.
    Use this option to tell configure where the GDBM files are located
    if it is unable to locate them on its own.

Another commonly used option is "--prefix=PREFIX", which you should use
if you want OOMon to be installed in a location other than the default
of "/usr/local/oomon".  Many users may find it desireable to use the
option, "--prefix=$HOME/OOMon", to have OOMon installed into their
home directory.

If the script is unable to find your C++ compiler (this is NOT the same
as not being able to find the GNU C++ libraries), you might try the
following:

	CXX=g++;export CXX
	./configure

Or for those using csh and its derivatives:

	setenv CXX g++
	./configure

If it STILL doesn't work, make sure a C++ compiler is actually
installed.  Chances are one isn't!

In fact, if on your system c++ is NOT GNU C++, I recommend you use
GNU's compiler anyway.  It's what I use, and who knows what sort of
crazy things other compilers do!

Please note that it is no longer necessary to modify oomon.h at this
point.  All configurable settings can now be modified at run-time
through the use of the ".set" command.

With that said, you can now build the executable:

	make

Assuming no errors occurred, when the build completes you should
then install OOMon with the following command:

	make install

When the install completes (without errors), modify the oomon.cf
(and userlist.cf) files to suit your needs.  These should be
located within the installation directory structure.

Once that's done, you're ready to roll.  To start it:

	./oomon

I think that's everything.

NOTE TO USERS OF HYBRID-7 BASED SERVERS:

You will need to install and load the spy_*_notice.so modules in order
to see STATS notices, etc, with oomon.  You should be able to find
these modules in the contrib/ directory of your ircd source tree.

For those who are interested, I have successfully built and run OOMon
on the following platforms:

	FreeBSD
	Solaris
	Linux
	Cygwin

If you have any success stories to add, please let me know!
